This is the Introduction for the English Language 
English is the easiest and an international language.
I plan to learn english form the Utkarxh School.
I need to ensure that not only I completely understand english grammar I know when and where to use it.
I also need to immprove my vocubalury and use the newly learned word in my daily life. 
In this section I want to use it as notes for the daily new work active recall.
God speed.
