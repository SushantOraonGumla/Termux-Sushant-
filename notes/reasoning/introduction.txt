This is the Introduction for the reasonng subject.
Since reasoning is more less practive based subject this notes is only for review and active recall and making sure I am learning What I am suppose to learn and not wasting time. 
I also have to work on my typing ability and typing on keyboard of a laptop is very different from that of real keyboard.
Due to space reasons attaching the keyboard to the laptop is a big problem both in the visibility of test and speed and accuracy among other things.
